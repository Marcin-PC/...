Ex Libris Student Portal Sample App - My Rails Library
================================================

Introduction
------------

This is a port of the [My Alma Library sample application](https://github.com/jweisman/MyAlmaLibrary) into Ruby on Rails.

The original application does the following:
* Authentication with Google OAuth
* Library card- displays some basic student information and allow users to update a few key data elements
* Requests- shows a list of the student's requests, and allow the user to cancel them

More information about the original C# app is available in this [blog entry](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/blog/Creating-a-Student-Portal-with-the-New-Alma-APIs).

About the App
-------------
The application is written in Ruby on Rails and uses the new Alma APIs described [here](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/apis).
